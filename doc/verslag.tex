\section{Preface}
Stereo vision is one of the key subjects in the computer vision research. Stereo vision can be best described as taking two viewpoints in a 3D world, comparing the distance between the position of an object in both images and relating that to the distance of an object to the camera. Such information is retreived by a dense stereo algorithm of which the output is often a disparity depth map. A disparity depth map is a 2D image where the color of each pixel is directly linked to the distance of the pixel on that coordinate in the original image, in order words if an object is white it is depending on the implementation nearer or further away than a darker object. Our goal is to generate such a depth map from two images taken with two webcams.

\section{OpenCV}
OpenCV is a library of programming functions for real time computer vision. By using this library we can constrain our tasks to integrating various parts of OpenCV and expanding it where possible. If we would not use OpenCV, we would not have enough time to achieve our goal. OpenCV is a C library but has python binding which we will use to decrease the risk of programming errors.

 \frametitle{Goal}
 \begin{block}{Goal}
   Generating a disparity depth map of the environment using stereo vision.
 \end{block}

 \frametitle{Why it is interesting}
   A depthmap can be used for various purposes:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item 3D modeling of a 2D enviroment
    \item Tracking of objects
    \item Recognising front objects
    \item As information about the environment in path planning
   \end{itemize}


\section{Problems}

 \frametitle{Theoretical problems}
   Stereo vision in a real life environment can be split up in several subproblems:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Camera calibration problems
    \item Generating epipolar line
    \item Occlusion
    \item Matching points in both images
   \end{itemize}

\section{Approach}

  \frametitle{Approach}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Camera calibration
    \item Epipolar geometry
     \item Dense stereo algorithms
      \begin{itemize}
       \item Graph Cut
       \item Believe Propagation
       \item Region Based
      \end{itemize}
    \item Using the OpenCV library
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Separate goals}
  The goal can be seperated into two independent subgoals:

  \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Calibration and rectification} Starting with two cameras and building a rectified image
   \item \textbf{Dense stereo} Starting with a rectified image and building a dense disparity map \\ \textit{Can use an external dataset}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Practical problems}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Getting webcams to work
   \item Learning OpenCV
   \item Selecting and understanding the right dense stereo algorithm
  \end{itemize}
